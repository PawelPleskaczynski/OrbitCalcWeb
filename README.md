# OrbitCalc

This is a website app which can be used to calculate orbital parameters of any observed satellite.

## How to use this website

To use this app, you need to know three values: observed size of an object (in arcseconds; you can calculate this value using built-in calculator), real size of the object and height of the object in the sky in degrees. With this information you can calculate how far the satellite was during imaging, how high it orbits above the Earth, how long it takes to orbit the Earth, etc.
